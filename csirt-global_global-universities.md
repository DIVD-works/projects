## 2. Project Background & Problem Statement

### **I. Background**

Universities and academic institutions worldwide are increasingly targeted by cyberattacks. A recent incident at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) highlighted the urgency for enhanced cybersecurity. Hackers were detected in real-time, disrupting education and delaying exams.  
Such attacks not only cause operational disruptions but also jeopardize sensitive student, faculty, and research data. University-affiliated medical centers face similar risks. A proactive cybersecurity approach is essential to maintain educational and research continuity while minimizing damage.  
This research initiative stems from the urgent need to address growing cyber threats. Through ethical hacking, CSIRT.global seeks to map vulnerabilities and support universities in enhancing their digital security.  

### **II. Problem Statement**

Many universities lack sufficient insight into their digital vulnerabilities, making them more susceptible to cyberattacks. The key contributing factors include:  

- **Limited Proactive Measures:** Many universities react only after an incident occurs rather than identifying and mitigating threats in advance.
- **Resource & Expertise Deficiency:** Universities often lack the necessary resources and specialized knowledge to counter sophisticated cyber threats effectively.
- **Complex Digital Infrastructure:** Universities operate extensive IT environments, making it challenging to maintain comprehensive vulnerability oversight.

Without proper security measures, cyberattacks can lead to data breaches, educational and research disruptions, and reputational damage.  
**Project Objective:** This project aims to improve the current cybersecurity landscape by identifying vulnerabilities, implementing security improvements, and increasing resilience against cyber threats. Without this initiative, the academic sector remains an attractive target for cybercriminals, with potentially severe societal consequences.
